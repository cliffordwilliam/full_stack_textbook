-   Search engine optimization (SEO)

## Timeline

### November 1989

-   Tim Berners-Lee created the global hypertext project, which became known as the World Wide Web.
-   Text-only HTML was the standard.
-   Most browsers were Unix-based.
-   The Mosaic browser began integrating graphic design.

### November 1992

-   CERN launched the first website on the World Wide Web.
-   Websites used table elements for layouts.

### November 1993

-   ALIWEB, the first search engine, was created.

### October 1994

-   W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was established to prevent monopolization by proprietary browsers and programming languages.
-   W3C continues to set web standards.

### 1994

-   Andreessen formed Mosaic Communications Corp, later Netscape Communications, and released the Netscape 0.9 browser.

### 1996 to 1999: The Browser Wars

-   Microsoft and Netscape competed, leading to innovations like CSS, JavaScript, and Dynamic HTML.

### 1996

-   Microsoft released its first competitive browser, supporting style sheets.
-   Table tags were still commonly used for layouts, with little concern for semantics or accessibility.

### December 1996

-   W3C introduced CSS, separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS) and promoting semantic HTML.
-   Table tags were still prevalent.

### 1998

-   Netscape released Netscape Communicator's code under an open-source license.
-   The Web Standards Project was initiated to develop standards for HTML and CSS.

### 2000

-   Internet Explorer became the first browser to support HTML 4.01, CSS 1, and PNG format.
-   By 2001, Internet Explorer held 96% of the web browser market share.

### 2001-2012

-   Websites evolved as web usage grew.
-   Post-browser wars, new open-source browsers outperformed Internet Explorer.
-   W3C developed new standards, including HTML5, CSS3, and new JavaScript APIs.
-   HTML5 became a term encompassing HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript standards.

### 2012 and Later

-   With the rise of 3G and LTE, web traffic shifted to mobile devices.
-   Web design adopted a mobile-first approach, prioritizing mobile layouts.

## Tools and Technologies

-   Vector and raster graphics editors
-   WYSIWYG website builder software or content management systems
-   Hand-coded web pages
-   Markup validators for web accessibility guidelines (e.g., semantic HTML, ARIA)

## UX Design

UX Design focuses on creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users, particularly in web-based contexts.

## Skills and Techniques

### Marketing and Communication Design

Effective design varies based on the target market. Designers must understand whether a site is B2B or consumer-targeted, as retail and entertainment sites require different approaches. Web designers typically meet with clients to discuss layout, color, graphics, and design.

### User Experience Design and Interactive Design

Clear layout, instructions, and labeling enhance a website's perceived usefulness, encouraging continued use. The goal is to create a universal user experience that accommodates users of all skill levels.

### Progressive Enhancement

This strategy prioritizes web content, ensuring immediate access to basic content and functionality, even on low-end machines. HTML is served first, followed by CSS and JavaScript, maximizing compatibility and minimizing load times. Sites like Wikipedia use progressive enhancement, while others, like Everipedia, may not.

### Page Layout

Fixed-width websites were common in the past, but fluid layouts gained popularity around 2000. Modern responsive web designs use CSS3 and the @media rule. In March 2018, Google announced mobile-first indexing, favoring responsive designs in search results.

### Typography

Limiting font variety improves visual consistency and performance. Safe fonts available in most browsers are recommended. With CSS3, web typography has become more sophisticated, often utilizing negative space and avoiding center-aligned text.

### Motion Graphics

Entertainment websites frequently use animations. However, W3C accessibility standards require that animations be disableable by users.

### Quality of Code

Good practices, such as clear element functions and maintainable layouts, prevent "tag soup" (poorly written HTML). Use W3C validation tools to ensure your HTML is semantic and standards-compliant.

### Generated Content

Web pages can be static or dynamic:

-   **Static Websites**: Files are assembled on the server and sent as-is to the browser. Clicking a button reloads the entire page.
-   **Dynamic Websites**: Parts of the page can update independently. They may use relational or document databases (e.g., MongoDB or NoSQL). Early dynamic pages used Perl, PHP, or ASP, with templating methods like EJS tags.

Content management systems like WordPress allow users to create and manage pages without coding, including user authorization for page edits.

### Technical Communication in Web Design

Effective communication enhances the perceived validity and usefulness of work. The communication coefficient measures how well complex concepts are explained, based on these principles:

1.  Communication influences how others perceive our work.
2.  Judgments about communication quality depend on personal factors like experience, preferences, and technical background.
3.  Communication matters in all interpersonal interactions to varying degrees.

## Homepage Design

Historically, the homepage was crucial for attracting visitors. However, by the 2000s, traffic began bypassing homepages for internal content. By 2007, homepages were considered less important. In 2013, the use of carousel sliders on homepages became common, though they were later deemed ineffective for SEO and usability.

## Occupations in Web Design

Creating a website typically involves several roles:

-   **Web Designer**: Focuses on visual aspects, layout, coloring, and typography. In larger companies, this role often involves only HTML and CSS. In smaller companies, designers may also need coding skills.
-   **Web Developer**: Specializes in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development.
-   **Graphic Designer**: Creates logos, layouts, and buttons.
-   **Internet Marketing Specialist**: Develops marketing and promotional strategies to maintain web presence.
-   **SEO Writer**: Recommends keywords to improve search engine rankings.
-   **Internet Copywriter**: Writes appealing content for the target audience.
-   **User Experience (UX) Designer**: Focuses on user-centered design, testing, interaction design, and visual design.

## 2.3 How Can I Become a Really Good Web Developer?

### Do not Get into Development for the Wrong Reasons

Becoming a developer should be driven by a passion for the craft and the instant gratification that comes with seeing your code come to life. The ability to make changes and see the outcome with just a refresh can be incredibly rewarding. However, don't pursue web development solely because you dream of becoming an internet entrepreneur, are enticed by high salaries, or are attracted to the culture of tech companies. These perks are not guaranteed, and many clients you encounter may be former developers who did not succeed or gave up.

The bottom line is that if you don't genuinely have a passion for at least one aspect of web development, it's wise to reconsider. A true developer cares deeply about their work and the products they create. You'll find greater satisfaction when you value your technical skills more than any external rewards.

### Find Where You Fit In

Web development is a vast field. It's important to identify your interests and strengths. You might start as a front-end developer and later explore back-end development or vice versa. Understanding where you fit in will help you focus your learning and growth effectively.

-   Jeffrey Zeldman
-   Molly Holzschlag
-   Jeremy Keith
-   Eric Meyer
-   Bryan Veloso
-   Jason Kottke
-   Ben Alman
-   Paul Irish
-   Rebecca Murphy
-   Jonathan Snook

Being part of the community will keep you updated on industry trends, best practices, and provide valuable networking opportunities.

### Buy Books and Read

Invest in ePub versions of books, as physical ones can quickly become outdated. However, for topics on general practices or architecture, physical books can be useful. Some recommended front-end books include:

-   [SMACSS (free version available)](http://smacss.com/)
-   [Bulletproof Web Design](http://www.simplebits.com/publications/bulletproof/)
-   [A Book Apart Series](http://www.abookapart.com/)
-   [O'Reilly books](http://oreilly.com/css-html/index.html)

Reading extensively will expand your knowledge and keep you informed about the latest developments in the field.

### Practice, Challenge Yourself, and Work for Others

Regularly code for fun and re-create existing projects to sharpen your skills. Consider building websites for non-profit organizations to gain experience. Participate in coding challenges to push your boundaries. Always be honest about your abilities and avoid overselling yourself. Continuous practice and real-world experience are crucial to becoming a proficient web developer.

## Introduction

Asking technical questions requires skill. Poorly formulated questions not only waste your time but also the time of the person you're asking. It's important to be good at asking technical questions to get the most helpful responses and make the process smoother for everyone involved. In this chapter, you will learn how to ask better questions.

## Learning outcomes:

-   Techniques for asking good questions.
-   Understanding the traits of bad questions and how to avoid them.
-   Ability to ask clear and productive questions moving forward.

## Provide Context:

Before asking someone for help, put yourself in their shoes. Imagine you have no prior knowledge of the project you're working on. With this perspective, it becomes clear that providing a comprehensive context is crucial. The best way to do this is by offering a step-by-step explanation, starting from the most general aspects and moving towards the specific details.

If your issue requires others to understand the project as a whole, begin by explaining what you are trying to create. Describe your approach, including the data structures or algorithms you've chosen, and how you've organized the project. Continue providing details until you focus on the specific issue at hand.

However, if your problem is isolated and doesn't require a full project overview, simply explain the steps to replicate the issue. Include relevant error messages, the specific line where the execution stops, or the buggy function or line of code.

When asking a question, aim to minimize the number of follow-up questions others will need to ask to understand your context. Prioritize providing clear and detailed context from the start.

## Focus on the issue not your made up solution:
